## 🚀 Quick Integration Steps

### Step 1: Register the New Blueprint

Add to your main `slot_booking_webapp.py`:

```python
from gamification_routes import gamification_bp

# Register the blueprint
app.register_blueprint(gamification_bp)
```

### Step 2: Update Your Existing Gamification Route

Modify your existing `/gamification` route to include new features:

```python
@app.route('/gamification')
@require_login
def gamification():
    try:
        user = session['current_user']
        
        # Import new systems
        from prestige_system import prestige_system
        from daily_quests import daily_quest_system
        from personalization_system import personalization_system
        
        # Get enhanced data
        prestige_data = prestige_system.calculate_user_prestige(user)
        today_quests = daily_quest_system.get_user_daily_quests(user)
        customization = personalization_system.get_user_customization(user)
        
        # Your existing code for badges, level, etc...
        # Add the new data to your template context
        
        return render_template('gamification.html',
            current_user=user,
            # ... your existing variables ...
            prestige_data=prestige_data,
            today_quests=today_quests,
            customization=customization
        )
    except Exception as e:
        # Error handling
        pass
```

### Step 3: Update Your Booking Function

Add quest progress updates to your booking logic:

```python
from gamification_routes import update_quest_progress_for_booking

# In your booking function, after a successful booking:
booking_data = {
    "has_description": bool(description),
    "booking_duration": time_taken_seconds,  # if you track this
    "booking_time": datetime.now().hour
}

update_quest_progress_for_booking(user, booking_data)
```

### Step 4: Add Navigation Links

Update your existing templates to include new feature links:

```html
<!-- In your main navigation or gamification dashboard -->
<a href="{{ url_for('gamification.daily_quests') }}" class="nav-btn">
    <i class="ti ti-target"></i> Daily Quests
</a>

<a href="{{ url_for('gamification.analytics_dashboard') }}" class="nav-btn">
    <i class="ti ti-chart-bar"></i> Analytics
</a>

<a href="{{ url_for('gamification.prestige_dashboard') }}" class="nav-btn">
    <i class="ti ti-star"></i> Prestige
